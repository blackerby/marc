# Learning Rust and MARC

This repo hosts my efforts to learn Rust by learning to parse MARC records. It's heavily influenced by [fml](https://github.com/MITLibraries/fml) and [marcli](https://github.com/hectorcorrea/marcli), both of which are Go projects. I also take peeks at [rust-marc](https://github.com/blackbeam/rust-marc), the industrial strength MARC library for Rust, but it's doing some stuff that's way above my head.

Updates to this repo will be intermittent at best.
